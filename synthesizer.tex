\section{Synthesizer}
Given a the list of edits and cells, the synthesizer generates a Python program that given future unlabeled dirty data in the same schema will predict the the label. This Python program converts the proposed edits into a decision tree of if-else statements. It is impractical to retrain the neural network for each new test datum, and this cost is 3 orders of magnitude than SQL-based constraints. With code synthesis, initial experiments suggest that this optimization reduces evaluation time to within 1.7x of optimized SQL constraints.
